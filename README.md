Sentiment Analysis of the 2020 US-Presidential Election

These are the two notebooks that i created for my bachelors thesis.

- "Machine Learning": This notebook deals with the creation of the ML model which i then used in the next notebook:
- "Sentiment Analysis with ML on Election Tweets" to do the Sentiment Analysis

There are detailed descriptions available inside the notebooks, explaining what i did and why.
